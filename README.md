## HTML Recipe Website
A simple html website showcasing recipes and basic html functions!

The idea for this project came from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).
Even though it was just a basic project idea that thousands of programmers would and do come up with, I
liked it for **giving me the possibility to further solidify my learnings by constant repetition within coding.**

As always, I am a very perfectionist person, not at all meaning myself but my code and projects themselves.
I tend to correct every little detail I find imperfect, be it a single unnecessary space or missing a period at
the end of a list item, and I think that shows within my code. It may take one or two more minutes in the 
process of setting things up but saves a lot of time and effort when trying to edit or alter code at a
later point in time, be it for me or someone else.

*Needless to say*, projects like these are *probably* not the kind of projects you will edit/alter or
even use at any point in time in the future, but it shows and represents how I work and how I organize
my work environment to possible future employers and/or collaborators, **which is why I keep it up in
all my projects.**
