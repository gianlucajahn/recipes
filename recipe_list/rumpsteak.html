    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 rump steak</li>
            <ul>
                <li>It should weigh around 500 grams</li>   
                <li>It should measure around 5 centimeters in thickness</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Vegetable oil or groundnut oil</li>
        <li>Flaky Sea Salt</li>
        <li>Black Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Food Preperation Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove the steaks from the fridge and allow them to come to room temperature at least an hour before you begin.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180Â°C/gas mark 4.</li>
        <li>Place a heavy-based frying pan or griddle pan over a high heat and add a splash of vegetable or groundnut oil. <br />
            Pat the steak dry with a paper towel and sprinkle both sides generously with flaky sea salt.</li><br />
        <li>When the pan is very hot, with the oil almost at smoking point, add the steak and cook for 3 minutes on each side.</li>
        <li>If there is a thick layer of fat on the outside, hold the steak with tongs, fat-side down, so it can brown for around a minute.</li>
        <li>Transfer the steak to a roasting tin and put it into the oven for 10â€“15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the steak from the oven, season with pepper and rest on a warm plate, covered loosely with foil, for a further 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Slice and serve with your choice of accompaniments.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Serving Suggestions</h3>
    <p>Chips are the classic accompaniment to a good steak and easier than you think to make at home, especially if you have a deep fat fryer. <br />
       Go all out with Tom Aikensâ€™ Truffle chips or just follow his method even if you donâ€™t fancy the luxury extras.</p>
    
    <p>Spinach, wilted or creamed is another lovely steakhouse side or just keep things simple with a mustardy dressed green salad. <br />
       Finish off with a quick pan sauce or a tarragon-flecked BÃ©arnaise.</p>

    <p><strong>Congratulations</strong>, you're done! Enjoy your steak!</p>
